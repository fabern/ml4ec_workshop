Now that you are familiar with the basic steps for supervised machine learning, you can get your hands on the data yourself and implement code for addressing the modelling task outlined in Chapter \@ref(motivation). 

## Reading and cleaning

Read the CSV file `"./data/FLX_CH-Dav_FLUXNET2015_FULLSET_DD_1997-2014_1-3.csv"`, select all variables with name ending with `"_F"`, the variables `"TIMESTAMP"`, `"GPP_NT_VUT_REF"`, and `"NEE_VUT_REF_QC"`, and drop all variables that contain `"JSB"` in their name. Then convert the variable `"TIMESTAMP"` to a date-time object with the function `ymd()` from the *lubridate* package, and interpret all values `-9999` as missing values. Then, set all values of `"GPP_NT_VUT_REF"` to missing if the corresponding quality control variable indicates that less than 90% are measured data points. Finally, drop the variable `"NEE_VUT_REF_QC"` - we won't use it anymore.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

ddf <- read_csv("./data/FLX_CH-Dav_FLUXNET2015_FULLSET_DD_1997-2014_1-3.csv") %>% 
  
  ## select only the variables we are interested in
  select(starts_with("TIMESTAMP"),
         ends_with("_F"),   # all meteorological variables
         GPP_NT_VUT_REF,
         NEE_VUT_REF_QC,
         -contains("JSB")) %>%

  ## convert to a nice date object
  mutate(TIMESTAMP = lubridate::ymd(TIMESTAMP)) %>%

  ## set all -9999 to NA
  na_if(-9999) %>%

  ## drop QC variables (no longer needed), except NEE_VUT_REF_QC
  select(-ends_with("_QC"), NEE_VUT_REF_QC) %>% 

  mutate(GPP_NT_VUT_REF = ifelse(NEE_VUT_REF_QC < 0.9, NA, GPP_NT_VUT_REF)) %>% 
  select(-NEE_VUT_REF_QC)
```

## Data splitting

Split the data a training and testing set, that contain 70% and 30% of the total available data, respectively.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(rsample)
set.seed(1982)  # for reproducibility
split <- initial_split(ddf, prop = 0.7)
ddf_train <- training(split)
ddf_test <- testing(split)
```


## Linear model

### Training

Fit a linear regression model using the base-R function `lm()` and the training set. The target variable is `"GPP_NT_VUT_REF"`, and predictor variables are all available meterological variables in the dataset. Answer the following questions:

- What is the $R^2$ of predicted vs. observed `"GPP_NT_VUT_REF"`?
- Is the linear regression slope significantly different from zero for all predictors?
- Is a linear regression model with "poor" predictors removed better supported by the data than a model including all predictors?

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## fit linear regression model
linmod_baser <- lm(
  form = GPP_NT_VUT_REF ~ ., 
  data = ddf_train %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    select(-TIMESTAMP)
)

## show summary information of the model
summary(linmod_baser)

## Models can be compared, for example by the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). 
## It penalizes complex models and is optimal (lowest) where the trade-off between 
## explanatory power on the training set vs. number of predictors is best. The BIC
## tends to be more conservative than the AIC.
BIC(linmod_baser)
```

The variable `PA_F` was not significant in the linear model. Therefore, we won't use it for the models below.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## Fit an lm model on the same data, but with PA_F removed.
linmod_baser_nopaf <- lm(
  form = GPP_NT_VUT_REF ~ ., 
  data = ddf_train %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    select(-TIMESTAMP, -PA_F)
)

## The R-squared is slightly lower here (0.6903) than in the model with all predictors (0.6904)
summary(linmod_baser_nopaf)

## ... but the BIC is clearly lower, indicating that the model with PA_F removed is better.
BIC(linmod_baser_nopaf)
```

Use caret and the function `train()` for fitting the same linear regression model (with all predictors) on the same data. Does it yield identical results as using `lm()` directly? You will have to set the argument `trControl` accordingly to avoid resampling, and instead fit the model on the all data in `ddf_train`. You can use `summary()` also on the object returned by the function `train()`.
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(caret)

linmod_caret <- train(
  form = GPP_NT_VUT_REF ~ ., 
  data = ddf_train %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    select(-TIMESTAMP), 
  method = "lm",
  trControl = trainControl(method = "none")
)

summary(linmod_caret)
```


### Prediction

With the model containing all predictors and fitted on `ddf_train`, make predictions using first `ddf_train` and then `ddf_test`. Compute the $R^2$ and the root-mean-square error, and visualise modelled vs. observed values to evaluate both predictions. 

Do you expect the linear regression model trained on `ddf_train` to predict substantially better on `ddf_train` than on `ddf_test`? Why (not)?

Hints:

- To calculate predictions, use the generic function `predict()` with the argument `newdata = ...`. 
- The $R^2$ can be extracted from the model object as `summary(model_object)$r.squared`, or is (as the RMSE) given in the metrics data frame returned by `metrics()` from the *yardstick* library. 
- For visualisation the model performance, consider a scatterplot, or (better) a plot that reveals the density of overlapping points. (We're plotting information from over 4000 data points here!)

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(patchwork)
library(yardstick)

## made into a function to reuse code below
eval_model <- function(mod, df_train, df_test){
  
  ## add predictions to the data frames
  df_train <- df_train %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    mutate(fitted =  predict(mod, newdata = .))
  
  df_test <- df_test %>% 
    drop_na() %>% 
    mutate(fitted =  predict(mod, newdata = .))
  
  ## get metrics tables
  metrics_train <- df_train %>% 
    yardstick::metrics(GPP_NT_VUT_REF, fitted)
  
  metrics_test <- df_test %>% 
    yardstick::metrics(GPP_NT_VUT_REF, fitted)
  
  ## extract values from metrics tables
  rmse_train <- metrics_train %>% 
    filter(.metric == "rmse") %>% 
    pull(.estimate)
  rsq_train <- metrics_train %>% 
    filter(.metric == "rsq") %>% 
    pull(.estimate)
  
  rmse_test <- metrics_test %>% 
    filter(.metric == "rmse") %>% 
    pull(.estimate)
  rsq_test <- metrics_test %>% 
    filter(.metric == "rsq") %>% 
    pull(.estimate)
  
  ## visualise with a hexagon binning and a customised color scale,
  ## adding information of metrics as sub-titles
  gg1 <- df_train %>% 
    ggplot(aes(GPP_NT_VUT_REF, fitted)) +
    geom_hex() +
    scale_fill_gradientn(
      colours = colorRampPalette( c("gray65", "navy", "red", "yellow"))(5)) +
    geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dotted") +
    labs(subtitle = bquote( italic(R)^2 == .(format(rsq_train, digits = 2)) ~~
                            RMSE == .(format(rmse_train, digits = 3))),
         title = "Training set") +
    theme_classic()
  
  gg2 <- df_test %>% 
    ggplot(aes(GPP_NT_VUT_REF, fitted)) +
    geom_hex() +
    scale_fill_gradientn(
      colours = colorRampPalette( c("gray65", "navy", "red", "yellow"))(5)) +
    geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dotted") +
    labs(subtitle = bquote( italic(R)^2 == .(format(rsq_test, digits = 2)) ~~
                            RMSE == .(format(rmse_test, digits = 3))),
         title = "Test set") +
    theme_classic()
  
  return(gg1 + gg2)
}

eval_model(mod = linmod_baser, df_train = ddf_train, df_test = ddf_test)
```

Here, the function `eval_model()` returned an object that is made up of two plots (`return(gg1 + gg2)` in the function definition). This combination of plots by `+` is enabled by the [**patchwork**](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) library. The individual plot objects (`gg1` and `gg2`) are returned by the `ggplot()` functions. The visualisation here is density plot of hexagonal bins. It shows the number of points inside each bin, encoded by the color (see legend "count"). We want the highest density of points along the 1:1 line (the dotted line). Predictions match observations perfectly for points lying on the 1:1 line. Alternatively, we could also use a scatterplot to visualise the model evaluation. However, a large number of points would overlie each other. As typical machine learning applications make use of large number of data, such evaluation plots would typically face the problem of overlying points and density plots are a solution. 

Metrics are given in the subtitle of the plots. Note that the $R^2$ and the RMSE measure different aspects of model-data agreement. Here, the measure the correlation (fraction of variation explained), and the average error. We should generally consider multiple metrics measuring multiple aspects of the prediction-observation fit to evaluate models.

## KNN

### Check data

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ddf_train %>% 
  mutate(split = "train") %>% 
  bind_rows(ddf_test %>% 
    mutate(split = "test")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:9, names_to = "variable", values_to = "value") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = value, y = ..density.., color = split)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free")
```

### Training

Fit two KNN models on `ddf_train` (excluding `"PA_F"`), one with $k = 2$ and one with $k = 30$, both without resampling. Use the RMSE as the loss function. Center and scale data as part of the pre-processing and model formulation specification using the function `recipe()`.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(recipes)

## model formulation and preprocessing specification
myrecipe <- recipe(
  GPP_NT_VUT_REF ~ TA_F + SW_IN_F + LW_IN_F + VPD_F + P_F + WS_F, 
  data = ddf_train %>% drop_na()) %>% 
  step_center(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) %>%
  step_scale(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes())

## fit model with k=2
mod_knn_k2 <- train(
  myrecipe, 
  data = ddf_train %>% 
    drop_na(), 
  method = "knn",
  trControl = trainControl("none"),
  tuneGrid = data.frame(k = c(2)),
  metric = "RMSE"
  )

## fit model with k=30
mod_knn_k30 <- train(
  myrecipe, 
  data = ddf_train %>% 
    drop_na(), 
  method = "knn",
  trControl = trainControl("none"),
  tuneGrid = data.frame(k = c(30)),
  metric = "RMSE"
  )
```

### Prediction

With the two models fitted above, predict `"GPP_NT_VUT_REF"` for both and training and the testing sets, and evaluate them as above (metrics and visualisation). 

Which model do you expect to perform better better on the training set and which to perform better on the testing set? Why?

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
## with k = 2
eval_model(
  mod_knn_k2, 
  df_train = ddf_train, 
  df_test = ddf_test
  )

## with k = 30
eval_model(
  mod_knn_k30, 
  df_train = ddf_train, 
  df_test = ddf_test
  )
```

### Sample hyperparameters

Train a KNN model with hyperparameter ($k$) tuned, and with five-fold cross validation, using the training set. As the loss function, use RMSE. Sample the following values for $k$: 2, 5, 10, 15, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 30, 35, 40, 60, 100. Visualise the RMSE as a function of $k$.

Hint:

- The visualisation of cross-validation results can be visualised with the `plot(model_object)` of `ggplot(model_object)`.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mod_knn <- train(
  myrecipe, 
  data = ddf_train %>% 
    drop_na(), 
  method = "knn",
  trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5),
  tuneGrid = data.frame(k = c(2, 5, 10, 15, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 30, 35, 40, 60, 100)),
  metric = "RMSE"
  )
ggplot(mod_knn)
```


## Random forest

### Training

Fit a random forest model with `ddf_train` and all predictors excluding `"PA_F"` and five-fold cross validation. Use RMSE as the loss function.

Hints:

- Use the package *ranger* which implements the random forest algorithm. 
- See [here](https://topepo.github.io/caret/available-models.html) for information about hyperparameters available for tuning with caret.
- Set the argument `savePredictions = "final"` of function `trainControl()`.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ranger)

## no pre-processing necessary
myrecipe <- recipe(
  GPP_NT_VUT_REF ~ TA_F + SW_IN_F + LW_IN_F + VPD_F + P_F + WS_F, 
  data = ddf_train %>% 
    drop_na())

rf <- train(
  myrecipe, 
  data = ddf_train %>% 
    drop_na(), 
  method = "ranger",
  trControl = trainControl(method = "cv", number = 5, savePredictions = "final"),
  tuneGrid = expand.grid( .mtry = floor(6 / 3),
                          .min.node.size = 5,
                          .splitrule = "variance"),
  metric = "RMSE",
  replace = FALSE,
  sample.fraction = 0.5,
  num.trees = 2000,          # high number ok since no hperparam tuning
  seed = 1982                # for reproducibility
)
rf
```

### Prediction

Evaluate the trained model on the training and on the test set, giving metrics and a visualisation as above.

How are differences in performance to be interpreted? Compare the performances of linear regression, KNN, and random forest, considering the evaluation on the test set.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
eval_model(rf, df_train = ddf_train, df_test = ddf_test)
```

Show the model performance (metrics and visualisation) on the validation sets all cross validation folds combined.

Do you expect it to be more similar to the model performance on the training set or the testing set in the evaluation above? Why?

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
metrics_train <- rf$pred %>% 
  yardstick::metrics(obs, pred)

rmse_train <- metrics_train %>% 
  filter(.metric == "rmse") %>% 
  pull(.estimate)
rsq_train <- metrics_train %>% 
  filter(.metric == "rsq") %>% 
  pull(.estimate)

rf$pred %>% 
  ggplot(aes(obs, pred)) +
  geom_hex() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(
    colours = colorRampPalette( c("gray65", "navy", "red", "yellow"))(5)) +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(subtitle = bquote( italic(R)^2 == .(format(rsq_train, digits = 2)) ~~
                          RMSE == .(format(rmse_train, digits = 3))),
       title = "Validation folds in training set") +
  theme_classic()
```
